Alfred Workflows
=====================
A listing of the Alfred workflows that I have collected for regular use, including a few that I have put together myself.  Maintained by [@mttjhn](https://github.com/mttjhn).

## Utilities

- [Knocktounlock App](https://github.com/saschaeggi/alfred-knocktounlock) (by [@saschaeggi](https://github.com/saschaeggi))
	* Interfaces with the excellent [Knock App](http://www.knocktounlock.com) to more easily lock your Mac. I use this many times each day to replace the default `lock` command in Alfred with the Knock equivalent.
- [Kill Process](https://github.com/ngreenstein/alfred-process-killer) (by [@ngreenstein](https://github.com/ngreenstein))
	* Very handy way to quit applications, especially those that don't show up in the usual app-switcher (`Cmd-Tab`).

## Programming

- [Open with Sublime Text](https://github.com/franzheidl/alfred-workflows/tree/master/open-with-sublime-text-2) (by [@franzheidl](https://github.com/franzheidl))
	* It's similar to choosing open with when browsing folders/files with Alfred, but I like the ability to type `subl` in Alfred to open the file/folder that's currently selected in Finder. And the `subl*` concept is a tad quicker, too.
	* _Note to self: it would be good to check out some of the other "Open with..." workflows in [@franzheidl's](https://github.com/franzheidl) repo._
- [Encode / Decode](https://github.com/willfarrell/alfred-encode-decode-workflow) by ([@willfarrell](https://github.com/willfarrell))
	* Really handy when you need to figure out what something is in XML or URL encoding without having to look it up. Also does base64 encoding.
- [Dash](https://github.com/Kapeli/Dash-Alfred-Workflow) (by [@Kapeli](https://github.com/Kapeli))
	* The official Alfred workflow for the excellent [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash), a very cool offline documentation tool for Mac OSX. I've found that the Alfred workflow sometimes it gets in the way of what I'm trying to do (e.g. Google something about `bash`, and instead Alfred starts searching Dash for documentation). Otherwise, a cool and handy workflow. Might want to look for something different because of the challenges mentioned above.

## Productivity

- [Doing](https://github.com/EvanLovely/alfred--doing) (by [@EvanLovely](https://github.com/EvanLovely))
	* Just recently saw a post from [@ttscoff](https://github.com/ttscoff) about [doing](https://github.com/ttscoff/doing), his CLI tool for time tracking and just keeping track of what he was last doing. For me, time tracking has become a bit of a chore because I forget what I did all day long, especially with the many interruptions at work. This workflow leverages the `doing` command to make it easier to keep a running log of what I was doing just now so that I can jog my memory later when I have to enter my time at work.
	* _Note that I had to hack this workflow a bit to get it running with my non-system installed version of ruby. See [this issue logged to the workflow on GitHub](https://github.com/EvanLovely/alfred--doing/issues/1) for details._
